# ⚡️ Capacitor Data Storage SQLite Plugin
Capacitor Data Storage SQlite  Plugin is a custom Native Capacitor plugin to store permanently data to SQLite on IOS and Android platforms and to IndexDB for the Web platform.
As capacitor provides fisrt-class Progressive Web App support so you can use this plugin in your app which will later be deployed to the app stores and the mobile web.

## To use the Plugin in your Project
```bash
npm install --save capacitor-data-storage-sqlite@latest
```

Ionic App that shows an integration of [capacitor-data-storage-sqlite plugin](https://github.com/jepiqueau/ionic-capacitor-data-storage-sqlite)

## Limitations
The first release of the plugin includes the Native IOS code (Objective-C/Swift) using Capacitor v1.0.0-alpha.36

## Roadmap
    - Native Android code
    - Web with IndexDB

As i am quite new in Capacitor and Swift do not hesitate to comment and challenge the code
